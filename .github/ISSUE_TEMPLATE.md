#### For bugs
- Rule Id (if any, e.g. SC1000):
- My shellcheck version (`shellcheck --version` or "online"):
- [ ] The rule's wiki page does not already cover this (e.g. https://shellcheck.net/wiki/SC2086)
- [ ] I tried on https://www.shellcheck.net/ and verified that this is still a problem on the latest commit

#### For new checks and feature suggestions
- [ ] https://www.shellcheck.net/ (i.e. the latest commit) currently gives no useful warnings about this
- [ ] I searched through https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues and didn't find anything related


#### Here's a snippet or screenshot that shows the problem:

```sh

#!/your/interpreter
your script here

```
