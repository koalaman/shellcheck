summary: A shell script static analysis tool
description: |
  ShellCheck is a GPLv3 tool that gives warnings and suggestions for bash/sh
  shell scripts.

  The goals of ShellCheck are

  - To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues that cause a
    shell to give cryptic error messages.

  - To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems that
    cause a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.

  - To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls that may cause an
    advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future
    circumstances.

  By default ShellCheck can only check non-hidden files under /home, to make 
  ShellCheck be able to check files under /media and /run/media you must
  connect it to the `removable-media` interface manually:

      # snap connect shellcheck:removable-media
