The goals of ShellCheck are:

  - To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues,
    that causes a shell to give cryptic error messages.

  - To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems,
    that causes a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.

  - To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls, that may cause an
    advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.

ShellCheck is written in Haskell, and requires GHC, Parsec3 and Text.Regex. 
To build the JSON interface and run the unit tests, it also requires QuickCheck2 and JSON.

On Ubuntu and similar, these are called:
  ghc libghc-parsec3-dev libghc-json-dev libghc-regex-compat-dev libghc-quickcheck2-dev
For older releases, you may have to use:
  ghc6 libghc6-parsec3-dev libghc6-quickcheck2-dev libghc6-json-dev libghc-regex-compat-dev

Executables can be built with cabal. Tests currently still rely on a Makefile.

Happy ShellChecking!
